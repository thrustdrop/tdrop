# tdrop
merkle tree bulk address token drop with signature claim

An attempt to facilitate bulk token airdrops to wallet addresses based on a .csv whitelist or .csv list of token holders. Ideally, the claim process is signature based to deter from "spam" airdrops. Signature based claiming creates the act of each holders wallet creating the token. Having a user claim a token is a subtle difference with beneficial legal consequences; as the wallet owner creates value for the indvidual person.
